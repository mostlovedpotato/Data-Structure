In this question we just have to compare with the lowest number in the array which we got so why just store the full array
instead we just keep updating one temp variable to the least number from the input array and then the answer would be the
differnce of the given minimum value each should attain and the minimum number in array.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int t;
  cin>>t;
	while(t--){
		int n, k;
    cin>>n>>k;
		int ans = k;
		for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
			int temp;
      cin>>temp;
			ans = min(ans, temp);
		}
		cout<<k-ans<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
